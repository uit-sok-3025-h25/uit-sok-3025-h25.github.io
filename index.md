This course delves into specialized areas of econometric modeling, with an emphasis on discrete choice models, panel data analysis, and causal inference. Students will be deeply involved in the foundations and applications of these techniques, and will utilize quantitative tools to analyze complex economic phenomena. Using a variety of open-source software environments for statistical computing and graphics, participants will engage in practical applications, deepening their understanding of these econometric methods. By the end of this course, students will be well-prepared to address nuanced economic questions using these specialized methods.
